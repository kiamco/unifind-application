        review: "Having a call with Unifind really helped me a lot. It enlightened me on not only applications, but residence, school life, fees, and so on. The person I talked to was very open minded, patient and nice, she properly and thoroughly answered my questions, now, I know what I want to do, and how to do it.It is like I was walking on both sides of of a path, not knowing which side to walk on, or which direction to go, after the call, I knew the better path to follow, and where to go. I do not regret this call, I would recommend this to students who want to see clearer paths of where they are going in uni, dorm life, and so on. If I would go back in time, I would definitely take the call again. Don’t miss this opportunity.",

        review: "Scheduling a call with UniFind has been a great experience for me to receive mentorship for not only how uni applications are going to work, but also how to handle stress with all the workload during university. I’ve gained knowledge on various things I was previously confused about, and none of my questions were left unanswered. The call was definitely worth it and I would recommend scheduling a call to other students who are unsure about application processes or just post-secondary in general",

        review: "Unifind was an incredibly helpful service when I was preparing my transfer applications. Their advisor's helped me organize myself so that I was on top of everything. I also gained a lot of insight in regards to what schools are looking for and was able to strengthen my applications accordingly. It was a very pleasant experience and I would recommend anyone applying to University to give it a try!",
